# we want to find out, between which variables do we have the best correlation
cor(result)
# the best / biggest correlation (0.56) is between bath- and bedroom.
# While we want to explain the price over bath- and bedroom, this correlation does not help.
# The only thing we can say with this correlation, is that it seems, the more bedrooms a house have,
# the more bathrooms it needs, which makes sense.
# When it comes to the correlation which we are interested in, the correlation between price and bathroom (0.52)
# seems better / stronger than the correlation between price and bedroom and price (0.26).

# We can now see, how the prediction for the price looks like:
# -886.829 $ + 904.367 $/bathroom * bathroom + -66.371 $/bedroom * bedroom
# The prediction formula makes not really sense like this.
# It predicts, that you get even money back if you buy a house with one bed- and bathroom.

summary(model_1)  # R^2: 0.2703
# From the summary, we learn, that the adjusted R-squared is even higher than the ones from our single regression models.
# It seems, that we have a bit more accurate model than the single regression models.
# With this model, we can explain the prices to 27.03%. This is still not much and not satisfying.
# Standard Error: 2160 $ (in thousands). 95% of the prices lie between Â± 2 * 2160


hist(model_1$residuals)
# With the look at the histogram over the residuals, we can say, that the model is not good enough.
# The distribution of the residuals looks strongly right skewed and not in a bell pattern.

# residuals vs. bedroom: variation seems very high between 7 and 12 bedrooms

# Summary Model 1:
# Our analysis shows, that the model is not good enough.
# The histogram over the residuals shows clearly no bell pattern.
# Also, the formula for the partial regression indicates a bad model.
# Overall, the residuals from our model are not satisfying.

# Even thought the benefit for our model is questionable, we can see some interesting things here:
# For example, we have a quite low residual value. We could assume, that the price is quite stable over all counties.
# The interesting thing we learn from the plot above, is that the smaller the county is,
# the smaller the standard deviation is
